Dataset analysis

This repo contains the R scripts thatthe UCI HAR Dataset converts into a tidy data set.

Requirements

Create a R script that does the following

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
- Creates a tidy data set with the mean of each variable for each activity and each subject.

When you run the file run_analysis.R the tidy_dat.txt will be written in the workdirectory

The codebook available in this repo describes everything that will be done to make the tidy_data textfile.
